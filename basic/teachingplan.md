# Teaching Plan: Optimizing Service Requests in Big Data Platforms


## 1. Intended learning outcomes

This course focuses on understanding key patterns in assuring performance for service requests in large-scale big data platforms and optimizing such requests in the design of big data platforms. After completing this course, students are able to understand how to handle many requests in big data platforms by applying different techniques like throttling, queue-based load balancing and elasticity of service instances in your design and implementation.

This course is for master students and is expected that the participating student is familiar with key concepts of cloud computing, service computing and distributed systems.

## 2. Teaching methods and motivation for them

We will follow a combination of Problem-based learning (PBL), Inquiry Teaching and Project Work where we will present issues due to real problems based on real-world cases and we will analyze key techniques and principles for solving problems in the context of real systems. This combination is needed due to the complexity and diversity of techniques and technologies in big data platforms. Furthermore, key techniques in big data platforms cannot be understood without exercises with state-of-the-art technologies via project work.

## 3. Assessment of learning

To assess the student's understanding, we will give students an assignment reflecting a real situation as a project work after the course. Students will have to design  suitable solutions by demonstrating the implementation of their design in the real cloud environment.

## 4. Timeline

The planned timeline for the teaching is as follows.
