## Dealing with “An unexpectedly heterogeneous group of students”

## Situations

Questions:

*What kinds of adjustments can we do to the ongoing course to ensure that the teaching would be relevant and motivating to all students in a way that they will gain at least some understanding about the topic?*

Given the situation, I would adjust the ongoing course by focusing only on two important aspects (as the course is ongoing and there would not be too much time to do many things):
## Content and teaching sessions:
We cannot compromise the learning objectives and assessments. Therefore, it is important adjust the outcome expectation (e.g., every student will pass the course and be happy). Some students are not active and well-prepared that we could not change but they might not have enough time and be busy with other stuffs. Therefore, we give them more time and introduce new checkpoints between different contact sessions:
* Extend the time between two contact sessions. This might lead to the situation is that course length takes a bit longer but still we can achieve within the full semester
* Introduce a mini report/learning logs checkpoint in the middle of the two contact sessions: this report is a kind of requirements to force students to really spend time to self-study. Penalties and rewards can be introduced but the checkpoint makes sure that students can come after   doing some work at least and the time extension allows them to achieve this.

The two changes might help to improve students lacking background to catch up but might not change the view of the students who have a strong background and wait for exciting research discussion.  In this case, the content of the reading materials have to be divided into: the lower part contain materials that would enable students to pass the course if learning properly and the upper part containing materials that would enable students to look at exciting things and the students who lack background might not be able to grasp the materials (but such students have to accept that they can only pass without reaching the excellent grade, due to the expected quality).
Contact sessions would be arranged to allow the discussion to move from basic to advanced stuffs for all sessions. Like the two-level materials: the basic stuffs are for the students lacking the background and the advanced stuffs are for other students. Like a tutorial, we can have 50% for basic and 50% for advanced users (ratios can be changed) within the same session (e.g. 2 hours) so that everyone can find his/her learning path, say grasping 80% of the content in the session. Avoid mixing strong students with weak students because at the master level it does not really work.

## Additional supports:
More self-learning materials can be provided, such as Python coding. Furthermore, if needed, between contact sessions, some background tutorials can be given to the students who lack background.  Tutorials can be given by assistants or suitable people for, e.g., searching literature work and building individual techradar.
How could Mariam take into account the heterogeneous student group when planning the course in the following years?
I would do a prerequisite check. This check will (1) suggest students not to join the course if they don’t have enough background and (2) provide hints/additional sources that students must learn to catch up with the background.  Then, I would introduce several tutorials that I know that students lacking background need. Such tutorials would be enough for self-learning to prepare the background.
I would then revise the course management/sessions based on the solutions I propose before to see if time should be extended, checkpoints should be introduced. And I think it is very important to structure the content based on the principle of “basic, intermediate and advanced” levels within contact sessions so that everyone can see his/her study path covered at least 80%. With diverse background, there will be no way to make sure that a session will satisfy 100% of students (with different expectations and knowledge they want to learn). We need to balance among different groups of students.
