# Pedagogical Works and Thoughts

As a teacher I have also spent quite amount of times to learn how to teach and to reflect my teaching principles. COVID-19 has triggered a lot of thoughts about my role as a teacher and what would be my way for doing teaching in the future. Therefore, I decide to make this site open.

*There are many other notes but I will need to look up my archive to bring them to this site. The current notes have just been written recently.*
